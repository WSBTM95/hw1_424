# Homework assignment
## Task 1
After taking a look at the database, there are a few things that can be said about it. For example, the size of the database is 22 columns by 7,891,130 rows. Some of the most important attributes of the data are the following: Date, Primary type, Location Desc., Arrest, and Ward. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Some potential users of this data can be people looking to move to chicago, looking to be safer, and those who are jsut curious about the data. A few use case that can be demonstrated with the data can be the following: Parents letting their kids go out with their friends, but reminding them of what places to be more vigilant at. New apartment seekers trying to find a place that is within their budget and is safe.

## Task 2
Here we will be discussing about domain questions that can drive the analysis of the data. The following are the questions:

* Did crimes committed change since the start of recording crime data? This question came up because there has been a lot of events over the couse of our lives that shaped each and everyone of. Therefore, one has to ask wheter or not the overall situation of events has made people better or worse. The attributes that will be used to look at this broad question will be Year and Primary type.

* Where do crimes tend to happen in chicago? Living in Chicago, one should know what are the safe and not so safe parts of their city, because it is always better to be safe than sorry. Plus, just knowing this information can put people's minds at ease knowing that their loved one can at least take active steps to be safe. Now, the attributes that will looked at the most will be Ward, Location description, and Primary type.

* Did the affects of COVID change the situation with crimes? During COVID, most of us had to stay put inside for weeks, and some of us liked that and others didn't. That is why checking the results of this era would be useful for the future to see if this would be a pro or con on lockdowns happening again. Some attributes that will be looked at will be Date and Primary types.

* Do dates have any influence on crime? Throughout the year, many people have different things going on depending on the holidays and weather. So, thinking about these parameters could help us understand why crimes tend to happen during certain months, time, or etc. The attributes that will be looked at will be Date, Primary type, and Location description.

## Task 3
Here we will be discussing about task abstraction that is derived from the domain question in the previous section.

* For the first question, we are going to analyze the data in order to produce a graph showing the over all trend of crimes over the histroy of recording the data. Also, while recording the trend in crimes, we could put them into different lines according to the type of crime committed. This was decided based on what is seen on the news, because they tend to push out that more and more of certain crimes are taking place. So, we just want to see if that is really the case. 

* As for the second question, we could do a search of the data to see which attributes tend to be more frequent in an area. This is so that people can easily lookup which areas tend to have what specific crime take place, thus this could lead people to be safe based on the type of crime. 

* For the question about COVID affects, we can be able to do a query on the data to show what all data looks like during lockdowns and after lockdowns to see what type of crimes are more likely to be committed after isolation. This was chosen due to how people reacted to finally be out the lockdowns after a good while, and when people got out anything could have happened during that time.

* Finally, for the last question we can do another query to do comparisons of months, days, holidays, and time to see if there a correlation between them. This was also decided on because the curiosity to see whether or not certain dates tend to be prone to having more crimes committed or less crimes committed. Perhaps dates may even cause more crime in order to prepare for the coming dates.

## Task 4

* This first visualization looks at all 36 types of crimes and plots them in a line chart according to the amount that has happend in a given year. Year will be on the x-axis, number of crimes will be on the y-axis, and a legend showcasing all types of crimes will be interactive to show the user only what they want to see. The main idea behind this graph is to present to the user how each type of crime changes over the course of time, and the user will be to see the vast differences between the crimes committed by type in the same year. The things that worked well is showing the user the degree of changes of crimes that started high and ended a lot lower. However, there are many types of crimes that can barely or not be seen at all due to how miniscule they compare to heavy hitting crimes. Also, since there are 36 types of crimes, there will be a hard time trying to distinguish between colors, shapes, or line graphics due to the amount of types. 

![Alt text](/20230920_170424.jpg "Viz 2")

* The second visualization also works on the question by putting all categorys side by side and compares the beginning to end year. The x-axis will be the names of the categories and the y-axis will be the percentage of change. The main idea behind this graph is to show the users the first and last year overall change of all crimes. This can be updated compare any two years of the user's choice for a better look at things. The positives of this graph are the showing the percentage of change between two years, and showing each crime's percentage change as well. The downsides of this graph has to lie with the showing of each percentage, because there were a couple of crimes that had more than 100% gain in crimes committed. In fact, comparing 2001 and 2023 there was a 14,000 percent gain of crimes which is not easily shown with others. Also, with the amount of types it could be hard for some people to read each category name.

![Alt text](/im3.jpg "Viz 3")
* The third visualization works on the question 2 by looking at locations and the type of crimes that are committed there in a picked year. On the x-axis will be the location description category and the y-axis will be the crime category. The main idea behind this graph was to show the user which types of crimes tend to happen in a certain location, and that can be used to compare other crimes in that location, differet locations but same crime, or even both. Now, this graph is a heatmap/matrix, so each (x,y) point will be a bigger and redder shape depending on the amount of crime. The good things about this type of is that the user can easily pinpoint what type of crime tends to happen at a certain location, and compare it against other crimes and/or locations. But, the downside of this graph is the showing of 36 crimes, and 36 location descriptions because it is just massive to see all at once. Not only that, but some crimes are committed 0 to 31000  in a year at certain areas. So, trying to show these massive differences with colors would be an issue. 

![Alt text](/im4.jpg "Viz 4")
* The fourth visualization also builds of the question 2 by showing the ranking of crimes that take place per ward. The main idea behind this graph was to show the user which wards tend to have the highest amount of crimes, and to show where that ward falls in rank compared to other wards. So, that the consumer and be safer. The x-axis will be the amount of crimes committed, and the y-axis will show which ward it happened in. This graph can help show the user which ward has the highest amount of crimes in a picked year, and show which wards are the runner ups. But, the downside of this type of graph can be seen with the display of all 50 wards which will make the graph very congested with data. Also, not included in the graph is all the crimes that happen without a given ward, thus leaving a good chunk of data out of sight.

![Alt text](/im5.jpg "Viz 5")
* The fifth visualization works on the question 3 by showing the trend of crimes committed across the span of 3 years which is pre, during, and post COVID. The main idea behind this graph was to show the drastic changes during the COVID era, so they could see if the pandemic mixed with lockdowns did affect crime rates. This graph has an x-axis of months along with the year, and the y-axis will be the amount of crime committed in thousands. The good thing that works about the graph is the ability to pinpoint historic events in a timeline along with the crimes committed in said month of year. That way the consumer can see how much of an impact lockdowns or COVID had on crimes. The downside about this graph is that the user cannot see what types of crimes had been affected the most due to COVID; plus, with a limit of three years one can't truly see the overall trend of crimes up to this current year. 

![Alt text](/im6.jpg "Viz 6")
* The sixth visual builds off of question 3 by showing the exact percentage change of each type of crime from 2019 to 2020 which is pre and during COVID era. The main idea behind this graph was to show the user which crimes increased or decrease during the years of COVID to see what lockdowns or the pandemic made criminals do more of. The graph's x-axis is the type of crime and y-axis is the percentage change of a crime. The good thing about this graph has to do with allowing the user to see which specific types of crimes increased or deceased. But, this graph can only compare between two years which doesn't include post COVID so the trend can't be seen properly. Also, some crime had a change over 300%, which would make it harder to see along with the others. 

![Alt text](/im7.jpg "Viz 7")
* This visual deals with the question 4 by showing the months and their overall total crime committed in said month. The idea for this graph was to see if there was a trend between months and crime, so that each month can be compared to the other months as well. The graph's x-axis are the months and the y-axis is the number of crime per 100,000. The good thing about this graph is that the user can see which months tend to have the least crime and which have the most. With that knowledge, one can see if there could be a trend between maybe weather, holidays, and etc. The downsides about this graph is that it uses all data points from every year to make this graph. Thus, this could lead to discrepancies due to historic events influencing the years as they go on. Also, the types of crimes are not shown, so one cannot see which type of crimes tend to increase/decrease per month.

![Alt text](/im8.jpg "Viz 8")
* The last visual builds off the last question by showing the percentage of crimes that are committed during a given hour of the day. The idea for this graph was to show the users what time does crime tends to "sleep" and when they start being active. The good thing about this graph is that one can see which hours tend to be the safest and which are not. The bad parts about this graph is that the percentages are small and so spread out that it kind of backfires on the graph. Also, with 24 hours in the pie graph the time and there percentages can be hard to read the small the slice gets.

## Task 5

* After creating all 8 graphs, looking back at them we can start to see why visualization means a lot to those who read them and to the question trying to be solved. Out of the 8 graphs made, I think that the fifth one was the best, because it showed a clear trend of the crimes during a historic event in my life. The other good ones that also were interesting were the heatmap, and the wards being ranked. The pros about these graphs were that the max crimes committed in a location jumped out to the user at a glance, which is good for those who want a quick answer. Now, there were some graphs that need some more work such as the pie chart, and the barchart of crimes per month. For those, it is harder to see which types of crimes correlated to month and time, thus not giving a better answer to the user. As for the question, I think that they gave an answer to each question, and some were more effect than other to say the least. But, each graph does a good job at using the data that was given, even if some data was too much to be drawn in.
